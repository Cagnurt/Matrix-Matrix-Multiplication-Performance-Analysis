# Matrix-Matrix Multiplication Performance Analysis

This repository contains a serial C++ implementation of matrix-matrix multiplication, also known as the Basic Linear Algebra Subroutine (BLAS3 operation). The code focuses on performance optimization techniques, specifically index ordering and loop optimizations, to improve the efficiency of the multiplication operation for dense matrices of various sizes.

## **Repository Structure**

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`src/`**: This folder contains the source code files for the matrix-matrix multiplication implementation.
- **`include/`**: This folder includes the header files necessary for the code.
- **`CMakeLists.txt`**: The CMake configuration file for building the project.

## **Getting Started**

To build and run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: **`git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git`**
2. Navigate to the project directory: **`cd repo-name`**
3. Create a build directory: **`mkdir build && cd build`**
4. Generate the build files using CMake: **`cmake ..`**
5. Build the project: **`make`**
6. Run the executable: **`./matrix_multiplication`**

## **Performance Optimization Techniques**

The code explores the following performance optimization techniques:

- Index ordering: The algorithm uses the (i, j, k) indexing system to optimize memory access patterns and cache utilization.
- Loop optimizations: Different loop optimization techniques are applied to enhance efficiency and reduce computational overhead.

## **Results and Analysis**

The code measures the performance of the matrix-matrix multiplication for different matrix sizes and optimization configurations. The results are analyzed and compared to evaluate the effectiveness of the applied techniques.
